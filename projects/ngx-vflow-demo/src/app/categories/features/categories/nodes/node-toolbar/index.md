You can add a `NodeToolbarComponent` to your node. The content of this component is automatically positioned near one side of the node, based on the value of the `position` input.

{{ NgDocActions.demoPane("NodeToolbarDemoComponent") }}

## Multiple Toolbars

It's also possible to add multiple toolbars to the same node by simply including multiple `NodeToolbarComponent` instances with different `position` inputs.

{{ NgDocActions.demoPane("MultipleNodeToolbarsDemoComponent") }}
