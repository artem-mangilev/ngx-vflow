You could create markers for both edges and connections.

For edges you could spicify `start` and `end` markers for corresponding parts of edge. Marker is now only two `type`'s - `arrow` and `arrow-closed`.

For connections you couls only specify end marker by `marker` property in `ConnectionSettings`.
