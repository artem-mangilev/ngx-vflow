This is a roadmap for `ngx-vflow`:

- improve consistency across browsers (mainly appeals to Safari)
- custom SVG shapes
- floating edges
- plugin system
- node rotation
- UI controls for flow
- support for more layout engines (Dagree, etc.)
- modal system for context menu
- lazy loading nodes based on current viewport (decrease initial bundle)
- HTML-based renderer as alternative to current SVG-based renderer
- Experimental canvas/webgl renderer for insane performance
