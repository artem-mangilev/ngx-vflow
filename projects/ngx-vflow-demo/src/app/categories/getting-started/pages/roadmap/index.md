This is a roadmap for `ngx-vflow`:

- allow more than 2 handles on node, and further handles API improvements
- subflows
- more customization to default nodes
- improve consistency across browsers (mainly appeals to Safari)
- improve documentation
- more curves
- selection mechanism, allow to select one or many nodes
- plugin system
- minimap
- UI controls for flow
- support for layout engines (Dagree, etc.)
- more complex background (patterns)
- z-index emulation for selected entities, it's a bit hard for SVG-based renderer
- more events for different actions
- modal system for context menu
- HTML-based renderer as alternative to current SVG-based renderer
- Experimental canvas/webgl renderer for insane performance
